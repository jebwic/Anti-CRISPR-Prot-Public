# Anti-CRISPR Protein Generation in silico
*Note: the full project (code and manuscript) is in a private repo* 

In this project, we fine-tuned ProtGPT2 using Anti-CRISPR data and subsequently generated putative Anti-CRISPR proteins. The generated proteins were evaluated for their realism using an Anti-CRISPR classifier. These constructs were then evaluated using AlphaFold2 and ESM-2 structure prediction based on pLDDT values. These results indicate that several putative Anti-CRISPRS were successfully generated. While these results fail to capture the binding or CRISPR-inhibiting performance of the generated Anti- CRISPRs, they help confirm that the constructs were realistically generated proteins.
